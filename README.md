# Chord-Simulator

# Task: 
To implement an Erlang based simulation of the Chord Peer to Peer system and determine the convergence hops for message to traverse to destination.

# What is Working?
Correct creation of chord with desired number of nodes and then calcualation of the average hops required for a given number of requests where each node maintains a finger table consisting of logN nodes.

# Steps for exection are given below:

- Run the project by using commands in terminal:

-> c(project3).

-> project3:runApp( NumNodes, NumRequests).
